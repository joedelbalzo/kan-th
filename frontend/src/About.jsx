                <h1>Founder: Kanica Allagh</h1>
                <p>
                  After spending 10 years in finance, from capital markets to investing, I came in close contact to valuation and financing
                  decision making for enterprises. I began noticing how these skills and products are gapped for SMBs, those who would
                  benefit the most.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  After experiencing the high growth environment Capsule, I saw firsthand the excitement and challenges of providing new
                  products to underserved users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Finally, I personally care about this problem. After advising close friends and relatives in the valuations of their
                  hard-earned businesses, I became completely overwhelmed with the problem and excited about the opportunity to serve this
                  market.
