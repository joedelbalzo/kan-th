              <p>
                After spending 10 years in finance, from capital markets to investing, I came in close contact to valuation and financing
                decision making for enterprises. I began noticing how these skills and products are gapped for SMBs, those who would benefit
                the most.{" "}
              </p>
              <p>
                After experiencing the high growth environment Capsule, I saw firsthand the excitement and challenges of providing new
                products to underserved users.
              </p>
              <p>
                Finally, I personally care about this problem. After advising close friends and relatives in the valuations of their
                hard-earned businesses, I became completely overwhelmed with the problem and excited about the opportunity to serve this
                market.
