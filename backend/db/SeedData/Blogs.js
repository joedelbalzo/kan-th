    title: "What Is Your Valuation and Why Does It Matter?",
    subtitle: "SMB owners have 90% of their entire net worth tied up in their business.",
    content: `<p>It is arguably the most important metric in your <i>life</i> — what all your tireless efforts (blood, sweat, and tears…) has led to! It is your savings, your retirement, your legacy for your family… But, many owners don’t know what their business’ valuation is. If this is you, keep reading.</p>

    <p> Okay, so what is valuation? A company's valuation is its overall financial worth or value in the market. It is typically a monetary figure, such as a dollar amount or a market capitalization. Valuation is a critical concept in finance and investment, and it matters for several reasons:
    </p>
    <div>
    <ul>
  <li><strong>Financing:</strong> Valuation is important when you are seeking external financing, such as debt instruments (e.g., loans) or equity instruments (e.g., venture capital, private equity). Lenders and investors use your valuation to assess your company's creditworthiness or investment potential. Your business valuation guides their decision.</li>

  <li><strong>Selling your Business or Buying Another Business:</strong> If you are selling your business, you need to determine at what price you would be willing to sell at and if that is fair for a buyer. If you are buying a business, you need to determine the value of the target company to negotiate a purchase price.</li>

  <li><strong>Strategic Planning:</strong> Company valuation is a great tool for strategic planning. It helps you understand your company’s financial health and make informed decisions about growth and capital allocation. It gives you insight into the metrics people will analyze when determining your valuation, so you can optimize those metrics. Above all, it gives you visibility into how to be a more valuable company in the future.</li>

  <li><strong>Benchmarking:</strong> Valuation allows you to compare your company’s performance and value with other competitors and industry benchmarks. You can better understand your company's relative strengths and weaknesses, or adapt the best practices of what others are doing.</li>

  <li><strong>Employee Relations:</strong> Employees love to be part of valuable businesses. In a world where unemployment is low, being able to say you are a multi-million dollar business (and have the credibility behind you), can give you a new way to recruit successfully. Later on, you may want to create an ESOP (Employee Stock Ownership Plan) to give employees the opportunity to benefit from their hard work.</li>
  </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
  So, is valuation a business credit score? No, its better. Business credit scores gives the power to lenders. It is their view of your “credit-worthiness.” Valuations do the same thing, but they do more. They not only give lenders a sense of your financeability, but they also give you information about your own wealth, and how to be worth more. Its a multi-purpose metric that gives you the power over your future. </p>

    title: "How to Value Your Business",
    subtitle:
      "What bankers don’t tell you (and charge you thousands of dollars for) is that valuing your business isn’t as mysterious as it sounds.",
    content: `
    <p> It’s not a secret, locked behind a wall of fancy finance jargon, that only a small group of elite CPAs have access to.  As an ex-banker, I’m here to (finally!) tell you what you need to know. 
    </p>
    <p>
    There are only a finite number of methods to go about valuing your business. The best valuations incorporate multiple valuation methods to arrive at the most accurate assessment. Common methods include:
    </p>
    <div>
    <ul>
    1. <strong>Market-Based Valuation:</strong>
        
        This methodology is based on comparing other businesses to yours. While the ratio-driven approach is simple and easy, it does not take into account characteristics that make your business unique. It can also be hard to find comparable company data.</li>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Market Comps:</strong> This method looks at similar businesses in the same industry or locality to determine the value of your business. You would would take a multiple (e.g. a ratio of sales-to-valuation) and apply that to your business to imply your valuation.</li>
        <li><strong>Precedent Transactions:</strong> This method looks specifically at transactions that have already occurred. So if a competitor recently sold their business, you can apply the valuation they received to a financial metric of your business (revenue, earnings, etc.) to imply your valuation.</li>
        
        When to use:
        <ul>
        <li>Want a quick and easy answer</li>
        <li>Many similar businesses exist to yours</li>
        <li>You can find data for similar companies</li>
        </ul>
    2. <strong>Income-Based Valuation:</strong>
        
        These approaches all take into account the cash generation and future growth trajectory of the business. They are more widely accepted, but they rely on assumptions that can shift your valuation when changed only slightly. 
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Discounted Cash Flow (DCF):</strong> This method estimates the present value of the business's expected future cash flows. It is used for both small and large businesses. While it requires the most amount of data on a business, its most detailed and commonly accepted methodology.</li>
        <li><strong>Seller's Discretionary Earnings (SDE):</strong> The SDE method is used for small businesses where the owner's role is significant. It takes into account the owner's salary, personal expenses, and other discretionary items to calculate the true earnings of the business. This is simpler than the DCF method, but more detailed than capitalization of earnings.</li>
        <li><strong>Capitalization of Earnings:</strong> This method involves dividing the expected earnings by a capitalization rate, which is typically derived from market data or industry standards. This is the simplest income-based method.</li>
        
        When to use:
        <ul>
        <li>You have a predictable, cash generating business</li>
        <li>You have industry and market knowledge to underpin assumptions</li>
        </ul>
    3. <strong>Asset-Based Valuation:</strong> 
        
        Imagine if you liquidated your business today - what would you get for it? That is the essence of this method. While it may be straightforward, it does not give you credit for the growth prospects of the business.
        <ul>
        <li><strong>Book Value:</strong> This is the simplest method, which involves determining the value of a business by subtracting its liabilities from its assets as reported on the balance sheet. However, book value is based on historical numbers (e.g., the price you bought a piece equipment for) rather than market value (e.g., what the price would be today for that same piece of equipment based on your upkeep, demand, etc.).</li>
        <li><strong>Fair Market Value of Assets:</strong> This approach assesses the fair market value of all the business's tangible and intangible assets. Tangible assets might include real estate, equipment, and inventory, while intangible assets could be trademarks, patents, or customer lists.</li>
        
        When to use: 
        <ul>
        <li>Liquidation of your business</li>
        <li>If your business is asset or inventory heavy</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <p>
    When done correctly, these methods incorporate market, industry, and macro conditions of your business to give you a comprehensive answer. 
    </p>
    <p>
    You may be thinking, “I know my valuation, it’s my back-of-the-envelope method!” You’re not wrong! But you may want to consider the numerous benefits that come with a multi-method valuation. You will have more credibility when talking to lenders, investors, and buyers when you have commonly accepted financial analysis to back up your valuation. Because you are using several methods together, your valuation will be much more accurate and you won’t be caught by surprise. Finally, using the same methods over time will allow you to track your progress in becoming more and more valuable.

    title: "What Private Equity Doesn’t Want You to Know",
    subtitle: "Understanding Private Equity",
    content: `
    <div>A lot of press has come up about “private equity” scooping up mom-and-pop businesses, from dental offices to roadside assistance companies.Who are these people and what should you know? Your favorite ex-private equity investor is here to answer your questions!</div>
    <div>In plain language, private equity (or “PE”) refers to a group of sophisticated investors that provide capital investment in exchange for equity, or ownership, of the business. Private equity firms typically pool capital from various investors to create “funds”, including from high-net-worth individuals, institutional investors, and pension funds. They then use this capital to make investments in private businesses. Many make money by buying private businesses, increasing the value of their investment, and then selling the business for a “return”.</div>
    <h2>Types of Private Equity Investors</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>For the earliest stage of companies, the primary investors are venture capital (VC) firms — they look for start-ups that are rapidly growing, and will soon be worth 10x+ what they are worth today.</li>
      <li>For profitable businesses, you have a combination of growth funds and leveraged buyout (LBO) shops. Growth funds provide growth capital to businesses, while LBO funds buy cash generating businesses with debt.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What is their “secret sauce”?</h2>
    <div>Private equity has been operating since the 1980s, but as the number of funds has exploded, their value creation methods have largely stayed the same. Here it is… what they don’t want you to know is <strong>how to use their methods to generate value and keep it for yourself!</strong> Instead of selling your business and letting the next owner reap the rewards of tried-and-true methods, you have the option of doing it yourself.</div>
    <h3>Ways to Make Businesses More Valuable</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Operational improvements:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Revenue (sales) growth:</strong> Sales is the same thing as revenue. The more you improve your year-over-year revenue growth, the higher your business is valued.</li>
          <li><strong>Margin expansion:</strong> Margin is generally defined as a profit / revenue ratio. Margin growth comes from generating more revenue with the same cost base.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Multiple expansion:</strong> For PE, this is the same thing as “buying low and selling high.”</li>
      <li><strong>Paying down debt:</strong> Private equity will borrow from lenders and use that debt to acquire a business.</li>
    </ul>
    <div><strong>The first step to creating a more valuable business is knowing what it is worth today. Once you find out, you’re unstoppable.</strong></div>

    subtitle: "So, you're thinking about selling your business, huh?",
    content: `
    <div>Hey there, fellow business owner! So, you're thinking about selling your business, huh? It's an exciting journey, but it can also be a bit overwhelming. Fear not, we've got some practical advice on what to look for when you're sifting through those buyer inbounds.</div>
  
    <h2>What to Look for in Potential Buyers</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Why Are They Buying?</strong>
        <div>Dig into the 'why.' Are they planning to take your business to new heights, expand it into new territories, or integrate it into their existing ventures? You want their intentions to match your business’s potential.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Financial Capability:</strong>
        <div>Think of this as the financial reality check. You need to know if the buyer can afford your business. Don't be shy about asking them to show you the money or share their financing plan.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Experience and Industry Know-How:</strong>
        <div>Imagine you're selling your beloved car. You'd feel better if you knew the buyer was a car enthusiast who's been around the block. The same goes for your business.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Track Record and Reputation:</strong>
        <div>It's like hiring someone for a job. You'd look at their resume, right? Similarly, check their past performance with acquisitions and other business ventures.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Timing:</strong>
        <div>You're setting a date for the prom. Make sure their timeline matches yours. You don't want to be left waiting at the door while they're still picking out their outfit.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Cultural Fit:</strong>
        <div>Don't ignore company culture. You want someone whose corporate culture vibes with yours. A good cultural fit means your employees won't feel like they're working for aliens post-sale.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Due Diligence Process:</strong>
        <div>Buyers who mean business will want to get all up in your books. Be ready to provide the paperwork they need to snoop around.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Purchase Price and Terms:</strong>
        <div>The money talk! Scrutinize the offer – from the purchase price to how the deal's structured.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Financing Game Plan:</strong>
        <div>Get the lowdown on how they're planning to bankroll the deal. Whether they're relying on loans, investor cash, or maybe even you for seller financing.</div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal and Regulatory Stuff:</strong>
        <div>This is where you consider potential hurdles that could trip up the sale. Make sure the buyer is aware of any legal or regulatory challenges.</div>
      </li>
    </ol>
  
    <div>Selling your business isn't something you do every day. You've put in the work and created something valuable. Each sale is a unique journey, and what's important can change depending on your goals. And hey, you don't have to go it alone. Lean on the wisdom of legal and financial advisors who've been through this before. We’re happy to chat and put you in touch with our partners.</div>
  
    <div>As you navigate the journey of selling your business, remember, the right buyer is out there, and they'll honor the legacy you've built as they take your business into the future. Good luck!</div>

    title: "The Rising Tide of Search Funds and What that Means for Owners",
    subtitle: "Subtitle Not Null",
    content: `
    <p>In today's ever-changing world of entrepreneurship and small business ownership, there's a seasoned player taking the spotlight – <strong>search funds</strong>.</p>
  
    <p>Now, if you haven't heard much about search funds, you're not alone. They used to be a bit of an underdog in the entrepreneurial scene. But guess what? They're rapidly gaining popularity, and it's not hard to see why.</p>
  
    <p>Take, for instance, the recent MBA grads of 2023. It's been a rocky road for them in terms of job prospects. You can read more about it <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-06-01/harvard-mba-grads-anxiously-navigate-a-tepid-job-market?sref=JuSsFiEr">here</a>. Traditional MBA recruitment sectors like consulting, finance, and tech are slowing down their hiring engines, and when they do hire, it's often for specialists in hot fields like data analytics or AI. Tough luck for new grads. But here's where search funds come into play.</p>
  
    <h2>What is a Search Fund?</h2>
    <p>A search fund is like a treasure chest of capital raised by an entrepreneur or a small group of “searchers”. Their mission? To track down, acquire, and actively manage a small or medium-sized business. They roll up their sleeves and become the new owners, ready to make things happen.</p>
  
    <p>Why is this so darn appealing to these searchers? Here's the deal: with a search fund, they get to skip all that startup uncertainty. They're stepping into a ready-to-go business. Now, these searchers can focus on what they do best: growing, scaling, and operating that business their own.</p>
  
    <h2>What Does This Mean for Business Owners?</h2>
    <p>Let's be real; finding the right company is the hard part for searches. These folks often go through a massive effort, emailing thousands of small and medium-sized business owners just to get a handful of conversations going. But the reality is, search funds that manage to find and acquire a business hover around a 60% success rate – meaning 40% never find a company to buy. It's a competitive, daunting journey for searchers, but how does this whole search fund hustle impact you as a business owner?</p>
  
    <p>Well, buckle up, because beyond the never-ending email traffic headed your way, you might find yourself in the crosshairs as a potential investment target. Someone may reach out to you, asking if you'd be open to an equity investment or selling your ownership.</p>
  
    <h3>Considerations for Business Owners</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Your Investment Preferences: Do some soul-searching and determine what types of investors you'd be open to engaging with.</li>
      <li>Timing: When would you consider a deal? Is it now, in a few years, or when specific conditions are met?</li>
      <li>Business Valuation: What is your business worth? Getting a realistic valuation is crucial.</li>
      <li>Prepare for Due Diligence: Be ready for the nitty-gritty. Make sure your financials are in order, and your customer data isn’t a mess.</li>
      <li>Define Your Objectives: It's vital to understand what you want from the deal. Is it a straightforward sale, or do you have certain expectations for the business's future?</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p>In the world of business, even with mutual interest, mishaps can occur. Things like lack of financial records, inaccessible customer data, or unclear objectives can throw a wrench into the gears of a promising deal. While market conditions might not be in your control, you can certainly get your own house in order.</p>
  
    <p>The bottom line: a bit of planning can go a long way. Setting yourself up for success means answering these questions ahead of time. It's all about being ready to seize opportunities when they come knocking at your door. Trust me; it's worth it.</p>

    title: "Should I Check the Valuation of My Business?",
    subtitle: "Your valuation is like your bank statement, your credit score, or your blood pressure!",
    content: `
    <p> It’s good to have a pulse on it, check any recent changes, and make sure it’s going in the right direction. Your valuation can change for a number of reasons, like if you move locations or sign more customers. If your valuation changes, you should be the first to know.</p>
  
    <h2>When to Check Your Business Valuation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Ongoing Management:</strong>
        <p>For most SMBs, checking your valuation monthly or quarterly is good practice. This frequency allows you to track your business's performance, identify trends, and assess its worth over time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>During Major Milestones:</strong>
        <p>Whenever your business reaches a significant milestone, such as a merger or acquisition, a new round of financing, or a major expansion, it's advisable to assess your business valuation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Before Seeking Financing:</strong>
        <p>If you're planning to seek additional financing or investment, it's crucial to conduct a valuation before initiating discussions with potential investors or lenders.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Succession Planning:</strong>
        <p>If you're considering passing your business to family members or employees or selling it in the near future, you should receive a valuation report as part of your succession planning.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Market Changes:</strong>
        <p>If there are significant shifts in your industry, market conditions, or economic factors that may impact your business's value, it's a good idea to assess the valuation more frequently.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Internal Strategic Planning:</strong>
        <p>When you are in the midst of annual planning, conducting a valuation can help you set realistic financial and growth goals.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Legal and Regulatory Requirements:</strong>
        <p>Some legal and regulatory requirements may necessitate regular valuations. For instance, if your business is involved in litigation, partnership disputes, or tax-related matters, you may need to perform valuations as mandated by the law.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  
    <p>Unfortunately, the biggest reason owners don’t check their valuation is because it can be time-consuming and expensive. We are here to change that — we are providing automated, easy and accurate valuation for free.</p>

    title: "Debt vs Equity financing. What you need to know.",
    subtitle: "The Two Primary Ways to Finance a Business",
    content: `
    <p>There are two primary ways to finance a business: <strong>debt and equity</strong>. The first one, <strong>debt</strong>, gets a lot of air-time! This is your traditional loan plus interest model. Common providers are large banks, regional or small banks, and online lenders.</p>
  
    <p>The lesser known option is <strong>equity</strong>. Equity investors are willing to exchange cash for ownership in your business. This can be minority ownership (less than 50%) or majority ownership (greater than 50%). Common equity investors are high-net-worth individuals or angel investors, family investment offices, venture capital, and mid-market private equity firms.</p>
  
    <h2>Equity Investment Example</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Say you are the owner of a bar. You want to move to a better location for your clientele, in a bigger space that will allow you to serve food. You are currently making $3m of revenue, but believe you can make $6m in this new space.</li>
      <li>Equity investment is a great option here. If you are willing to give some ownership of your business to an investor, they can provide the capital you need and become your partner.</li>
      <li>Think of Shark Tank! The sharks are equity investors. They negotiate an equity investment in exchange for a piece of ownership.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h2>When to Use Debt or Equity Financing</h2>
    <h3>Debt</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Stable Cash Flow: Debt financing is typically more suitable for businesses with stable and predictable cash flows.</li>
      <li>Specific Projects: If you have a clear and specific use for the funds, debt financing can be a targeted way to fund these projects.</li>
      <li>Short to Medium-Term Capital Needs: Debt financing is generally more suitable for short to medium-term capital needs.</li>
      <li>Tax Benefits: Interest payments on debt are often tax-deductible.</li>
      <li>Ownership Control: If you want to retain full ownership and control of your business, debt financing allows you to raise capital without diluting your ownership.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <h3>Equity</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High Growth and Risk Tolerance: If your business has high growth potential but lacks consistent cash flow, equity financing may be more appropriate.</li>
      <li>No Fixed Interest Costs: With equity financing, you don't have fixed interest expenses.</li>
      <li>Strategic Expertise: Equity investors often bring strategic guidance, industry expertise, and valuable networks to your business.</li>
      <li>Long-Term Capital Needs: Equity financing is well-suited for businesses with long-term capital needs.</li>
      <li>Dilution Acceptance: When you choose equity financing, you'll dilute your ownership as you issue shares or ownership stakes to investors.</li>
    </ul>
  
    <p><strong>The first step in evaluating what path is right for you is knowing your valuation.</strong> Without knowing your valuation, how do you know how much ownership you are willing to give to a partner? And what amount of cash you would expect in return? And if that is better or worse than your debt option?</p>

    title: "How Knowing Your Company’s Valuation Can Help You Get Financing",
    subtitle: "Accurate Valuations Can Open Financial Doors",
    content: ` <p>How much your business is worth, or its valuation, is the number one financial number that should top all others. Among its many benefits, <strong>the most important is that valuation can unlock financing doors for you</strong>. Here's why:</p>
  
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Attracting Investors:</strong>
        <p>When you have a clear understanding of your business’s valuation, you can present a compelling case to potential investors. Your valuation serves as a key indicator of your business's potential.</p>
      </li>

        <strong>Equity Investments:</strong>
        <p>If you're seeking equity financing, understanding your business’s valuation is crucial. It allows you to negotiate the terms of equity investments more effectively.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
