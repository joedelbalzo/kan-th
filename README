Small list of bugs noticed on initial deployment:

-I just noticed that you can't change Tags, and it also doesn't actually set the tags chosen. That's annoying. Anyways, here's the rest:
-Publish on an update doesn't actually work. That's not good. Gotta be able to update!
-Some confirmation that you've actually selected a photo. Right now, there is no "File Chosen" and so it just looks like you're not uploading any pictures.
-Loading state on the Publish button. Right now it waits for about a second (to talk to Postgres and AWS) and then the completed acknowledgment appears.
-Captions need to be saved appropriately.
-There's an issue with redirection -- if you go back to the blog after hitting publish by hitting "Vali" up above, you don't see the newest post. The only way to see the newest post is to refresh the state.
-This text box grows with really long sentences. It shouldn't grow as much as it just did.
-Text overflows the backdrop when publishing. Check out the post before that's all sorts of Lorem Ipsum. Text isn't wrapping appropriately
-Introduce instructions for the admin. %% regex for photos is not super easy to remember!
-Needs to be some sort of edited timestamp. I know that's annoying. Maybe it'll be a field to create? Like if there already is a publishedAt and we're creating a new one, create an "originallyPublishedAt?" or something. Idk.

Specific content to add:
-- (done) Legal page. Privacy Policy, ToS, I'm not the bible, etc

-- (done) Need a way to credit photos.

-- (done) Add "Tags" to the database
-- (done) make them searchable and therefore list how many are under each tag.
-- (done) A user should be able to click on a tag and find all relevant posts.
-- (done) An admin should also be able to see which tags exist, while also having the ability to create new tags.
-- An admin should be able to edit a tag name and have it fix it everywhere else. There needs to be some sort of warning here too that it'll effect all other articles with this tag name.

-- Documentation for the admin!!

-- Pagination

-- A way to receive feedback from early users.

-- Footer
--Should include the admin login, socials, dev'd by me, etc, maybe the feedback button goes here

Technical things to add:

-- Figure out the blog uploads.
-- the current wysiwyg doesn't allow for headings within a post. is my post only text? this obviously matters. it's weird that i can't change the sizes. also, should note then if i do that that titles will be h2's and subtitles will be h3's, so further headings should be at max h3's.
-- On this note, make sure the API calling the blog posts only calls the "home" images for the main page, and then an individual blog post will call the rest of the images.
-- one option here would be to figure out how to lazy load, or some other technique, where all of the home images are loaded first and then the content images (of just the blog posts on the current page) load

-- Analytics:
-- SEO will be important here. It's very important that users can find this blog with ease.
-- Implement Google Analytics scripts here.
-- Research more analytics. Things that can be measured can be improved.

-- Content Backups
-- Figure this out. Should there be a way to automatically upload the content to AWS or a google doc? Some way to truly save the data on top of what goes in the site, in case of a database reset or anything.
-- probably going to upload all of this to aws.

Down the pipeline:
-- Develop a real Nav bar. It's likely that this page will be a part of the whole service, and so when we move beyond the blog, this is likely to be one of the first needs.
