immediate fixes:
oauth needs to redirect for real, not to localhost
add kanica linkedin and email
login on mobile is weird. check your screenshots
portfolio submit needs to do something

long term -
seo shit, like the mobile menu close button doesn't need to be a link
form elements need labels, like for="firstname" or aria-label="firstname
focusable elements need unique ids, like the nav buttons
images need height and width, https://web.dev/articles/optimize-cls
pictures are too big for mobile, and it effects performance.

Small list of bugs noticed on initial deployment:

-I just noticed that you can't change Tags, and it also doesn't actually set the tags chosen. That's annoying. Anyways, here's the rest:
-Publish on an update doesn't actually work. That's not good. Gotta be able to update!
-Some confirmation that you've actually selected a photo. Right now, there is no "File Chosen" and so it just looks like you're not uploading any pictures.
-Loading state on the Publish button. Right now it waits for about a second (to talk to Postgres and AWS) and then the completed acknowledgment appears.
-Captions need to be saved appropriately.
-There's an issue with redirection -- if you go back to the blog after hitting publish by hitting "Vali" up above, you don't see the newest post. The only way to see the newest post is to refresh the state.
-This text box grows with really long sentences. It shouldn't grow as much as it just did.
-Text overflows the backdrop when publishing. Check out the post before that's all sorts of Lorem Ipsum. Text isn't wrapping appropriately
-Introduce instructions for the admin. %% regex for photos is not super easy to remember!
-Needs to be some sort of edited timestamp. I know that's annoying. Maybe it'll be a field to create? Like if there already is a publishedAt and we're creating a new one, create an "originallyPublishedAt?" or something. Idk.

Specific content to add:
-- (done) Legal page. Privacy Policy, ToS, I'm not the bible, etc

-- (done) Need a way to credit photos.

-- (done) Add "Tags" to the database
-- (done) make them searchable and therefore list how many are under each tag.
-- (done) A user should be able to click on a tag and find all relevant posts.
-- (done) An admin should also be able to see which tags exist, while also having the ability to create new tags.
-- An admin should be able to edit a tag name and have it fix it everywhere else. There needs to be some sort of warning here too that it'll effect all other articles with this tag name.

-- Documentation for the admin!!

-- Pagination

-- A way to receive feedback from early users.

-- Footer
-- Analytics:
-- Implement Google Analytics scripts here.
-- Research more analytics. Things that can be measured can be improved.
