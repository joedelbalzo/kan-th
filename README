immediate fixes:
add linkedin and email
login on mobile is weird. check your screenshots

long term -
form elements need labels, like for="firstname" or aria-label="firstname
focusable elements need unique ids, like the nav buttons
images need height and width, https://web.dev/articles/optimize-cls
pictures are too big for mobile, and it effects performance.

Small list of bugs noticed on initial deployment:

-Some confirmation that you've actually selected a photo. Right now, there is no "File Chosen" and so it just looks like you're not uploading any pictures.

-Captions need to be saved appropriately.

-This text box grows with really long sentences. It shouldn't grow as much as it just did.
-Text overflows the backdrop when publishing. Check out the post before that's all sorts of Lorem Ipsum. Text isn't wrapping appropriately
-Introduce instructions for the admin. %% regex for photos is not super easy to remember!
-Needs to be some sort of edited timestamp. I know that's annoying. Maybe it'll be a field to create? Like if there already is a publishedAt and we're creating a new one, create an "originallyPublishedAt?" or something. Idk.

Specific content to add:
-- (done) Legal page. Privacy Policy, ToS, I'm not the bible, etc

-- (done) Need a way to credit photos.

-- (done) Add "Tags" to the database
-- (done) make them searchable and therefore list how many are under each tag.
-- (done) A user should be able to click on a tag and find all relevant posts.
-- (done) An admin should also be able to see which tags exist, while also having the ability to create new tags.
-- An admin should be able to edit a tag name and have it fix it everywhere else. There needs to be some sort of warning here too that it'll effect all other articles with this tag name.

-- Documentation for the admin!!

-- Pagination

-- A way to receive feedback from early users.

-- Footer
-- Analytics:
-- Implement Google Analytics scripts here.
-- Research more analytics. Things that can be measured can be improved.
